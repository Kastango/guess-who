        <h4>Game Instructions:</h4>
        <p>Select a game board above, choose your username and hit enter to start the game. The computer will randomly
            choose a character from those on the game screen, and you have to try to guess them! <br><br>Begin by
            picking from the descriptions at the top of the game page to ask a question about the mystery character. For
            example, you can click "Hat?" to see if they are wearing
            a hat. If you're informed that the character is wearing a hat, click character cards to flip over all of the
            characters without a hat. If the mystery character is not wearing a hat, click to flip over all the
            characters that are wearing a hat. Through the process of elimination, you will eventually be able to
            “guess” the name of the mystery
            character.
            <br><br>Keep in mind that you have a limited number of turns, and guessing a character name counts as a
            turn. If you run out
            of turns before guessing the mystery character, you will lose the game. If you enter the
            right name before you run out of turns, you will win the game! See the leaderboard to compare your results
            against other players.</p>
