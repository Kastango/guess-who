<h2>Game rules:</h2>
<div class="game-rule">

<ul>
<li>The Player takes their game board of 24 faces and places one of 24 mystery cards in the empty frame in each game board. This card represents the character your opponent has to guess and the character you have to answer questions about.</li>
<br>
<li>Begin by asking the other player a characteristic found on on one of their 24 visible characters. Example: “ Does your character have brown hair?”</li>
<li>If they say, “yes,” the asking player flips over all of the characters without brown hair. </li>
<li>If they say, “no,” the asking player flips over the characters that have brown hair. </li>
<li>Through the process of elimination, players will eventually be able to “guess” the name of the opponents character.</li>
<br>

<li>Each player gets one yes or no question per turn and may only guess (to win the game) once per game. If a player successfully guesses their opponents hidden character then they win; if their guess is wrong then they lose.</li>
</ul>
