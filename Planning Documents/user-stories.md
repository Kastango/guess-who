As a __, I want __ so that __.

1. As an ESL (English Second Language) teacher, I want a simple game that I can use with my students where they can practice recognizing simple characteristic vocabulary in a fun way.

2. As a fan of the classic game, I am interested in playing a new version where characters are identified by characteristics other than their skin color or assumed gender because I think this is more realistic and interesting.

3. As a casual gamer, I'm looking for something to pass the time during my commute and other downtime so that I won't be bored.

4. As an adult ESL learner, I want to learn vocabulary for describing people that is socially acceptable yet helpfully descriptive, and I like the idea of a feature where I have to click the faces manually which helps me learn, but I can also reverse the click if I make a mistake.

5. As a fan of the classic game, I am interested in playing this game where I get the challenge and replay value of using multiple different sets of characters. (STRETCH -- skins and different character sets)

6. As a fan of the classic game, I like the idea of being able to play against a computer in a single-player game, and I like the idea of being able to change the difficulty level of the game to increase the challenge as I play. (STRETCH -- option to change number of guesses you get, or a timer)

7. As a parent, I want my child to be given positive feedback based on how they complete the game so that they can be encouraged to improve their effort and score over time. (STRETCH -- feeedback beyond just win/lose)
