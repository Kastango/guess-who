CONFLICT

1. What will our team do when it encounters conflict?

We will first acknowledge the conflict amongst ourselves and then we will discuss the impact of the conflict on our team's performance. Next, we will discuss options for solving the conflict, and agree on a way to proceed. Finally, we will address any communication issues that led to the conflict and try to avoid in the future.

2. How will we raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

We had a discussion on day one where we all agreed that we are comfortable speaking up to other members if we personally feel that we are doing a lot of heavy lifting and would like to distribute the work differently.

If there is a specific person that one or more group members feel is not adequately contributing, we favor direct but kind communication. The first step we would take is to just identify a specific task that needs to be worked on, and directly ask that person if they will work on that task. This is because we want to assume good faith in this situation. If the problem persists, we will be able to approach them about that, such as, "We asked you to do X. Do you need help?" and go from there. Our intention is to avoid accusatory language or assumptions that someone is intentionally slacking.

3. What is our process to resolve conflicts?

We will first follow the plan outlined in #1. If there is conflict about a particular decision, we will remind each other of our shared goals, namely, stick to MVP. If there are divisive issues, we also may take a vote or set time aside for people to present the reasoning behind their preferences and then decide together.

4. How and when will we escalate the conflict if our attempts are unsuccessful?

If we are unable to reach consensus on something for while, we will decide if we have spent too much time discussing the issue and if it hasn't been resolved, we'll ask a TA or instructor to step in and help.

COMMUNICATION

1. Communucation after hours:

We will use Slack to communicate after hours. If this presents limitations, we will re-assess.

2. Strategy for ensuring everyone's voice is heard:

We had a discussion already where we all agreed that we don't have issues with speaking up about our thoughts and needs. We also agree that decisions will not be implemented without everyone's consensus, and we will discuss these things as needed.

3. Ensure a safe environment where everyone can speak up:

We had a brief discussion wherein we all agreed that we feel comfortable asserting ourselves, and that if that changes, we are all open to discussing any issues. We will also have discussions each morning where we make sure that everyone gets a turn to speak up about anything they hadn't gotten to share, if necessary.
