A description of the project
    -The classic Guess Who board game is now online, we took the approach to help encourage learning, specifically ESL (English Second Language) people. 


The overall problem domain and how the project solves those problems
    Going back to our user-stories, 

    1. As an ESL (English Second Language) teacher, I want a simple game that I can use with my students where they can practice recognizing simple characteristic vocabulary in a fun way.

    2.  As a fan of the classic game, I am interested in playing a new version where characters are identified by characteristics other than their skin color or assumed gender because I think this is more realistic and interesting.

    We wanted to create a game, where it can help encourage learning and playing for fun!
